design patterns are used for building resuable and extensible object oriented software
elegant solution to repeating problems

element of resuable object oriented software by GOF

Advantage of design pattern:
They are reusable in multiple projects.
They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
They capture the software engineering experiences.
They provide transparency to the design of an application.

We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC

1. Creational ---- diff ways to create an objects
1.Factory Pattern ---define an interface or abstract class for creating an object
 but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate
2. Abstract Factory Pattern
3.Singleton Pattern
4.Prototype Pattern
5.Builder Pattern.

2. Structural ----- relationship about the objects
1. Adapter Pattern
2.Bridge Pattern
3.Composite Pattern
3.Decorator Pattern
4.Facade Pattern
5.Flyweight Pattern
6.Proxy Pattern

3. Behavioural  ---- interaction and comunication between the objects
1.Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
2.Command Pattern
3.Interpreter Pattern
4.Iterator Pattern -- allow to define own rules to how to travers collection object
5.Mediator Pattern
6.Memento Pattern
7.Observer Pattern --- define one to many. one object is known as subject and other known as Observer
8.State Pattern
9.Strategy Pattern --- encapsulate a group of family of closely related algorithm is called Strategy
10.Template Pattern
11.Visitor Pattern
